# ES2015 Modules Example

This is a very simple configuration of [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) for
supporting modules and compiling code through [Babel](http://babeljs.io/).

After cloning this project run:

    npm install

The available commands are:

- `npm start` - Start a development server. The app will be available at
http://localhost:8080
- `npm run build` - Simple build process joining all dependencies in one file.
The result will be available in `dist/app.bundle.js`
